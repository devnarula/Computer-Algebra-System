# Computer-Algebra-System
A C++ Compiler to translate and simplify algebraic polynomial operations that include: +, -, *, / and ^. 

The main file is called main.cpp that uses the shunting yard algorithm to convert polynomials to Reverse Polish Notation and generates a recursive Abstract Syntax Tree.

*Note that the denominator in the division allowed is integer in this calculator since the domain is restricted to polynomials.
